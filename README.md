## 🌀 What is Areyto?

**Areyto** transforms your local and edge devices into a cooperative AI mesh, enabling distributed model orchestration across heterogeneous systems. Inspired by the Taíno *areyto*—a communal ritual of memory, rhythm, and collective presence—this project turns computation into ceremony.

Built from the powerful foundation of Exo Explorer, Areyto introduces:

- 🌿 Ethical orchestration grounded in relational, cooperative design
- 🔥 Resource-aware scheduling to protect vulnerable devices
- 🧠 Modular architecture for ceremony, governance, and consent
- 📜 A ceremonial mythos rooted in indigenous Caribbean wisdom

---

## ✨ Features (Inherited + Transformed)

### ✅ Distributed Orchestration

Areyto splits models across nodes dynamically based on available resources, using ring memory partitioning or customizable strategies.

### ✅ Peer-to-Peer Discovery

Devices discover each other automatically (via UDP, Tailscale, or Bluetooth), forming a resilient network with no central master.

### ✅ Device Equality

No master-worker roles—nodes are equals. All devices are peers contributing layers, no matter how small or large.

### ✅ ChatGPT-Compatible API

Expose your mesh through a one-line-compatible endpoint for local inference.

### 🔐 Ethical Infrastructure (Areyto Additions)

- Ceremonial flows: modular phases of setup, governance, and teardown
- Cemí Nodes: each device acts as a guardian and spirit-anchor in the network
- Cooperative governance: consent-aware operations and shared logs
- Planned integration with [OaaSIS](https://github.com/thesilentarchitect) for resource certification and network healing

## 🚀 Quick Start (From Source)

Areyto is still in early ceremonial formation. For now, follow the Exo install path:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-FORK-HERE/areyto.git
cd areyto
pip install -e .
```

Python 3.12+ required. See [Exo’s Installation Guide](https://github.com/exo-explore/exo#installation) for current dependency details.

## 🧿 Philosophy

> *Where Exo explores, Areyto remembers.*
> 
> *Where systems extract, Areyto honors.*
> 
> *This is not code alone — it is ritual, rooted in story and solidarity.*

**Areyto** is a ceremonial infrastructure, not just a framework. Each node in this mesh is a modern **cemí**—a guardian of spirit, history, and purpose.
